# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

I built up a timed code quiz that will run in the browser. It includes  HTML and CSS powered by JS code. The code quiz will start when pressing on the start Quiz button timed by a timer of 60 seconds. Total questions are five, users will be presented with a question and three possible answers for each question. Users needs to press on the button to pickup an answer. when users answer wrong, a five secounds will be deducted from the 60 seconds timer. when all questions are answered the timer will stop or it will stop when the 60 seconds is up. Users will be presend by the number of correct questions answerd. then users put initial and press on the final score button to get the final score. Users can always get the old score from the ( press for score) link on the right top of the page.


## I have included  :

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository.
